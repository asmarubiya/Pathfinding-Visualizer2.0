# Pathfinding-Visualizer2.0

A dynamic Pathfinding Visualizer that demonstrates how various algorithms navigate a grid-based map to find the shortest path. Explore real-time animations and adjust settings to see how different algorithms handle obstacles and paths.

## Installation

- Install Node on your computer.
- Clone this repository and the backend repository from <a href="https://github.com/arnabuchiha/Algorithm-Visualizer.git">here</a>.
- Open CMD on your computer and change the directory to the place where you cloned the front-end repository.
- Run the command **npm install** to install all the necessary packages from the Node server.
- Now run the command **npm start** to run the frontend on your localhost.
- Follow the same procedure for the backend repository, to run the server on your localhost.
- Run the app live on **localhost:3000**.
